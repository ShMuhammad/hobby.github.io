          <h2>Playing Football</h2>
          <p>Football is my favourite hobby. It’s a team sport, in which you can score only by placing
            the ball inside the goal of the opposite team. 
            Football is not only my hobby but also help me improve my health. Here some health benefits of playing football:</p>

          <h2>Going to the Beach</h2>
          <p>Going to the beach is my all time favorite way to pass time. I like everything about it. 
            When I go during the day I do not like to go past 2pm because I feel like the sun is not very strong. 
            If i go to the beach at night I like to have a bon fire or look at the stars.

          <h2>Cooking</h2>
          <p>Cooking is the best hobby to have, because it can be very useful in life. 
            Cooking is my hobby and has been for several years. I was about five years old, 
            when I started learning how to cook. Cooking is something that I inherited from my grandmother; 
            my grandmother was a professional chef and owned her own restaurant, where I learned how to cook.
